# Project 3: Spots

An image sharing site

##

Spots is a responsive web page that showcases a user profile alongside a collection of image cards. The project focuses on clean layout structure, modern styling, and responsive behavior across different screen sizes. It is built using semantic HTML and CSS with Flexbox and media queries to ensure the interface adapts smoothly from desktop to mobile views.

The page includes a profile section with user information and interactive buttons, as well as a gallery of cards displaying images with titles and like buttons.
